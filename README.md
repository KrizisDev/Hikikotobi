# Hikikotobi (1.0.0)
An OMORI mod that replaces most battle themes with various tracks from the Undertale/Deltarune soundtrack.

## Changelog:
- Replaced PERFECTHEART's battle theme with MEGALOVANIA.
- Modified PERFECTHEART's pre-battle cutscene to *"just get to the point"*, as Sans would say.
- Implemented a new sound effect named `SE_hikikotobi_click`, used only during PERFECTHEART's pre-battle cutscene.
- *Sins can now crawl on your back.*

## Installation:
- Download **hikikotobi_v1.0.0.zip**.
- Go to OMORI's installation folder.
