# Hikikotobi (1.0.0)
An OMORI mod that replaces most battle themes with various tracks from the Undertale/Deltarune soundtrack.

## 1.0.0 Changelog:
- Replaced PERFECTHEART's battle theme with MEGALOVANIA.
- Modified PERFECTHEART's pre-battle cutscene to *"just get to the point"*, as Sans would say.
- Implemented a new sound effect named `SE_hikikotobi_click`, used only during PERFECTHEART's pre-battle cutscene.
- *Sins can now crawl on your back.*

## Installation:
- Download **hikikotobi_v1.0.0.zip** from [this page](https://github.com/KrizisDev/Hikikotobi/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
- Go to OMORI's installation folder.
- Extract the downloaded zip to `www/mods`. *(assuming you have already installed [GOMORI](https://github.com/Gilbert142/gomori))*
- Launch the game.

## Lite Version
There's also an alternative, more lightweight version of Hikikotobi which you can download either by [clicking here](https://github.com/KrizisDev/Hikikotobi/releases/download/v1.0.0/hikikotobi_lite_v1.0.0.zip) or going to the [Releases](https://github.com/KrizisDev/Hikikotobi/releases) page. **HOWEVER, THE [Resource Loader](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794907423592415272/809239938113077308/resource_loader.zip) MOD ALSO NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED, OR ELSE IT WON'T WORK PROPERLY.**
